# or simply
python run_local.py
```
or, if you want to run networks in Google Colaboratory, in surprise, simply push to git repo and jump to  
```

```
then, it is run on Google Colaboratory!! Super easy!!

## 1-click run demo on Google Colaboratory
Jump to below link, then run all code (manually or "runtime"->"execute all cells")
